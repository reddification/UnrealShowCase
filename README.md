# About
This project is a showcase of my UE4 learning progress.

## Content
There are 2 main maps: 
1. Demo map which contains various movement mechanics, interactable items, weapons and basic AI
2. CardboardCity which contains quest system and advanced NPC lifecycle demonstration. This level is a continuation of Autumn 2021 Siberian GameJam submission: https://aluminum-cockroachs.itch.io/murphyslaw which was mostly based on my code base

None of the models/textures/sounds/level design is made by me. Everything that is **not** mentioned below is made by me.
