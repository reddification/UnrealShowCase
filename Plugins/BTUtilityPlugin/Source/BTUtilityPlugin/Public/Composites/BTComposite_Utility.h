/** 
 * Utility selector node.
 * Utility Nodes choose at most one of their children to execute. The choice made is a function of the utility values of the children.
 * A Utility Node will succeed if its chosen child succeeds, and will fail if its chosen child fails or if no child could be executed.
 * The recommended design is to:
 *   - Pair this with Blackboard Utility decorators on child nodes, then point them to floats on the blackboard that define utilities.
 *     This avoids per-tick calculations.
 *   - Then update the blackboard values as you need to, e.g. via events. If you need something closer to per tick, create custom
 *     services and run them on this node, so that utilities are being checked for changes as long as we're running. The Blackboard Utility
 *     nodes automatically trigger a recalculation as soon as the value changes, aborting any running tasks to ensure we're always doing
 *     the one with the highest utility.
